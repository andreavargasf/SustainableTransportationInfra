    "This is the first notebook of a series of 5 (see below the names of full list) intended to teach you the functionalities of the pyhton-based LCA software Brightway 2.5 (BW25) that you will use to carry out your group assignment. For a more nuanced undertsanding of the principles and working mechanisms of BW25 you are referred to [its documentation](https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest/index.html).\n",

However, this is **not** a hard requirement since most methods are quite intuitive and will be explained throughput the tutorial.
