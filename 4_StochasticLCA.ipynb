    "This is the fifth notebook of a series of 5 (see below the names of full list) intended to teach you the functionalities of the pyhton-based LCA software Brightway 2.5 (BW25) that you will use to carry out your group assignment. For a more nuanced undertsanding of the principles and working mechanisms of BW25 you are referred to [its documentation](https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest/index.html).\n",

This would generate an error in the upcoming steps, as the name assigned in \"comments\" is used to identify the exchanges. Thus, if the same name is used for multiple exchanges, the upcoming calculations are unable to track the exchanges. Therefore, we have to change the comment in one of the exchanges mentioned before.

    "Next, we need to store information about the uncertainty of the exchanges (considered in the activities). Specifically, we are interested in the fields 'comments', 'uncertainty_type', 'loc' and 'scale' defined in the foreground and ecoinvent databases. Their meaning is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `uncertainty_type`: type of probability distribution function (pdf) that the exchange follows. In our foreground database, the exchanges have an uncertainty type = 2, indicating it is a `lognormal`  distribution. This is the type of pdf you should consider. A value equal to 0 means no uncertainty. More info about the uncertainty type and respective code can be found [here](https://stats-arrays.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",
    "- `loc`,`scale`:  parameters of the probability distribution function considered. In the case of the lognormal they are respectively the mean and the standard deviation of the underlying normal distribution. The natural logarithm of the _median_ of the lognormal distribution is equal to the median (=mean) of the underlying distribution.\n",
    "Considering the deterministic exchange amount `amount` to be the median, we have `loc` = `ln('amount')`. You can see this formula being used in the foreground database (excel file) \n",
    "As far as the standard deviation (`scale`) is concerned, the value is obtained from the basic and additional uncertainty, defined according to the pedigree matrix.\n",
    "For instance, if you look at the exchange 'diesel, burned in building machine' considered in the activity 'asphalt, construction', you will see that the `loc` value is 0,0374166. This value is the square root of the sum of the basic uncertainty (0,0006) and the additional uncertainty (0,0006 + 0 + 0,0002 + 0 + 0) corresponding to the example given in the uncertainty modelling lecture.\n",

    "In this (and last) step we are going to perfom a GSA using the Extra Trees method. But for this specific product system ,i.e. 'pavement_structure_1', we have to perfom a small operation before we run the Extra Trees  algorithm. This is because we run the LHS function for all exchanges stored in the list 'uncertain_parameters'. However, the activity that contains the exchange for which we defined a new name of 'comments' (i.e., 'A2_modbitumen_t') is not used in the product system 'pavement_structure_1'. Therefore, we have to delete it from the dataframe (named 'samples') that stores the samples created with LHS  for each exchange. We will do that by droping the respective column of the 'samples' dataframe:"
